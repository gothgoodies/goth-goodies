  <!-- Man Behind the Mask -->

    <h2>The Man Behind the Mask</h2>
    <p>[ My name is Hannah, the person behind the shadows. Jack of all trades. And everything you see here can be made to order. I just love designing and crafting. I've been doing everything under the 'art' moon since I was just a little girl. It all started with loom bands. Crafting has always been my middle name. I know it sounds cliche but...It was always me my best friend Lily Zimdars, who very sadly passed on in April of 2020. During our childhood, We made so many loom band bracelets, charms, and just everything and anything. We even took sewing classes together in summer school. After that, we would go play at my Great Aunts house which was a quilting shop back then. Lily and I would make the quilting customers easy bake oven goodies and whatever made them happy! She really helped me find my soul purpose- to CREATEü§ç. Everything i do is with love and intention. I don't ask for a lot money because what I do just means so much to me, and I know what it's like to struggle. I've been busting my ass to make a career for myself. A better life for me and my fianc√©, Ethan. I strive to make him and myself proud. I believe it's all about vibes! good energy! 
      I found my love for horror and gothy stuff in middle school when I became depressed. I was the odd one out. I went through a lot of friend groups and cliques, and couldn't figure out where I belonged. Thats when I eventually learned that you don't have to be a part of some 'group'. Your people will come to you, based off of your energy. I've worked on myself so much thoughout the years, and it's one of the hardest battles imaginable. 
      So here I am now, facing adulthood. The forest of the unknown. My plan is to continue bringing beautiful things into this world. To make people smile. In this path I walk today, whatever I stumble across, I use it to create something beautiful. ]</p>
