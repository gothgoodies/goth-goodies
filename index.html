Â  Â  <p>I've loved art since I was just a girl (not a vamp yet). This piece was created for an event at the Mary Hoard Art Museum when I was in elementary school. It was inspired by Andy Warholâ€™s style and featured my viola â€“ each square a unique color pairing based on opposites on the color wheel.</p>
